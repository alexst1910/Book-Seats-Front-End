# Book-Seats-Front-End

Here is a implementation of a booking seats platform using plain html, css and javascript with responsive design
The interface contains multiple pages, a main page that shows the navigation bar, a carousel item and a list of venues.
Each venue item contains a button that redirects to a page which a user can create a booking correspondent to that venue.
After a user enters the booking details, after submitting, it will be displayed a message that confirms that the booking has been saved.
The user is able to see the list of bookings that he has made by clicking the "My bookings" button from the navigation bar.
There the user can view the booking information and can update the information or delete the booking by pressing the correspondent buttons.
